# Snake (2D)
>Snake 2D game is typically implemented using a two-dimensional array to represent the game screen. The snake is represented as a series of coordinates, and its movement is determined by updating the coordinates of each segment of the snake based on the player's input. Collision detection is used to determine when the snake has hit a wall or its own tail. The food is represented as a separate set of coordinates, and the game logic updates the snake's length and score when the snake "eats" the food.
